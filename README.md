# Crack Detection and Repair Decision with OpenCV

This repository provides a Python script for detecting cracks in grayscale images and making decisions on whether repair is necessary based on the crack area. The code leverages OpenCV for image processing, edge detection, and contour analysis.

Features:

-Gaussian Blur to reduce image noise and improve edge detection accuracy.

-Canny Edge Detection for identifying potential cracks in the image.

-Morphological Transformations (Dilation and Erosion) to enhance detected crack features.

-Contour Analysis to calculate total crack area, aiding in the repair decision.

-Repair Decision based on a customizable threshold of total crack area.

Installation:
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:


pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Code Walkthrough:


detect_cracks(image_path): This function loads a grayscale image, applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise, detects edges using the Canny method, and then applies morphological transformations (dilation and erosion) to enhance crack features. It returns the processed edge-detected image and the original image.


repair_decision(crack_image, threshold_area=5000): This function analyzes the detected cracks by finding contours and calculating the total area of detected cracks. Based on a threshold (default: 5000 pixels), it determines if repair is required. Adjust threshold_area as needed for your application.

Output:


After running the script, it displays:


Original Image: The raw input image.


Crack Detection Result: A processed version highlighting detected cracks.


Additionally, it prints whether repair is recommended based on the specified threshold area.

Configuration:


threshold_area: Modify the threshold_area parameter in repair_decision to suit your application. A larger threshold will be more lenient, while a smaller one will detect more minor cracks as requiring repair.



Dependencies:


OpenCV: For image processing and feature detection.


NumPy: For efficient array operations.


Matplotlib: For visualizing the original and processed images.
